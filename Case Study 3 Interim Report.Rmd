Interim report 1: create an engaging visualization of observed infant mortality rates by year, county and race

```{r}
#Libraries
if (!require("readr")) install.packages("readr")
library(readr)
if (!require("dplyr")) install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)
```


```{r}
#Loading and Visualizing Data
data <- read_csv("Yr1116Death.csv")

data %>% group_by(year) %>% summarise(count_n = n())

data %>% group_by(race) %>% summarise(count_n = n())

data %>% group_by(hisp) %>% summarise(count_n = n())

data %>% group_by(cores) %>% summarise(count_n = n())
```

Potential Visualizations:
1. Can we figure out where all of these counties are located and show a heat map of deaths?
2. A similar visualization to what we made that changes over years. As years progress, shows changes in deaths of races? How should we show counties? 

```{r}

```
